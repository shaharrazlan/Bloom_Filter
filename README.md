### Test-Driven Development (TDD): ðŸŒ»:

Followed a TDD workflow for creating new classes.
Wrote initial basic tests for each class.
Built code incrementally based on test results.
Refactored and updated tests as needed.
### Docker: ðŸŒ»:

Implemented Docker for automatic creation of Dockerized versions for each release.
Pushed Dockerized versions to a private repository on DockerHub.

### Refactoring: ðŸŒ»:

Initially released version v1.0.0 with basic functions and no consideration for edge cases.
Upgraded to version v2.0.0, introducing branches, an interface, and a command design pattern.
Addressed edge cases and refined functions.
Made cosmetic changes and added a README file with version v2.5.0.
